Polymorphism
1.	What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?
It means many forms, occurs when many classes are related to each other by inheritance.
2.	What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
Occurs when many classes are related to each other by inheritance. Helping inheriting attributes and methods from another class. Like Car and Motorbikes both being Vehicles and inheriting from that class.
3.	What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
Inheritance
4.	How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
Many.
5.	Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
Cars, Motorbikes, Trucks all inheriting from Vehicle.
Composition and Aggregation
6.	What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
The design technique to implement has-a relationship in classes.
7.	When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
When a class for example Horse class can be composed by another object of type Tail, allowing to express the relationship by saying a Horse has a Tail. Enables to reuse code by adding objects to other objects.
8.	Give a difference between composition and aggregation?
In Aggregation objects can remain in the scope of a system without each other. In composition, objects cannot remain in the scope of a system without each other.
9.	What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?
More flexible than inheritance, no conflicts, doesnâ€™t break encapsulation.
10.	When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
It will also get destroyed.
11.	When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
It will still exist in the system.
